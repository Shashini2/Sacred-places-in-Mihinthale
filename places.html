  <h2>Kaludiya Pokuna</h2>
  <p><img src="kaludiya pokuna.jpg" style="width:8%">
Situated at the foot of the western slopes of Mihintale it is the largest of the ponds. Most experts believe that Kaludiya Pokuna may probably be the ancient Porodini Pokuna mentioned in the tablets of Mahinda IV.

Kalu-diya Pokuna, literally translated means the black water pool. It is said that the name evolved out of respect to the sombre reflections of trees and boulders of the neighbouring forests and mountains, and is true to its description at most times of the day.
The complex of well-planned buildings around the pond is witness to an advanced hydraulic civilization with artificial moats running through some of the buildings; the bathhouses, and the toilets within the buildings.</p>

  <h2>Lion Pond</h2>
  <p><img src="lion pond.jpg" style="width:10%">The pond known as the Lion Pond is found amongst the ruins in the ground opposite the Kantakacétiya in the opposite direction. Nourished by the waters flowing close by, this stone pond is artistically a significant construction. There is a lion standing with its back placed before the pond on the lower terrace below the pond. Water is discharged from the mouth of the figure of the lion, similar in arrangement to that found as a spout. It was possible to bathe while standing in front of the lion. This pond is dated to the 7" century. Thus it is evident that this was one of the most ancient ponds with a spout found in Sri Lanka.</p>

The origin of the stupa is unknown but a inscription refers to a grant to the vihara by King Mahadathika Mahanaga (9-21 AC) which indicate that the stupa must have been built in the pre christian era.

Set apart from the pilgrims’ way is the trek to Eth Vehera. It commands some of the best views of the surrounding area.

  <h2>Naga Pokuna</h2>
  <p><img src="Naga pokuna.jpg" style="width:10%">Naga Pokuna boasts of one of the main sources of natural water at Mihintale. It is situated on an elevated plateau on the side of a hill just below the Mahathupa and Mihindusaya.

Naga Pokuna literally translated as Cobra pond takes its name from the five hooded cobra cut in low relief on the rock surface above the pond. The tail of this cobra sculpture is said to reach the bottom of the pond.


It was connected in one hand with the Sinha Pokuna or the Pond of the lion and on the other with the Bat-ge or Refectory by means of channels and spouts made of stone. The spouts on pillars at the Bat-ge site can still be seen. As such the water required for bathing at the Sinha Pokuna and the water required for the alms hall was supplied by the Naga Pokuna.</p>

  <h2>Ata Seta Lena</h2>
  <p><img src="ata seta lena.jpg" style="width:10%">Mihintale monastery complex is covered with many sub units which the average traveller or the pilgrims are unaware of. Traveling few meters past the Lions Pond (Singha Pokuna) on the old road, you will come across a massive rocky outcrop on the right. The cluster of caves which has been built using these rock shelters are collectively called “Ata Seta Len” or the “Sixty Eight Caves”.

Early Brahmi inscriptions carved on the drip ledges of the caves confirms that these have been prepared for the use of Buddhist monks during the 3rd -2nd centuries before Christ.</p>

  <h2>Aradhana Gala</h2>
  <p><img src="aradhana gala.jpg" style="width:10%">Eight miles east of Anuradhapura, close to the Anuradhapura – Trincomalee Road is situated the “Missaka Pabbata” which is 1,000 feet (300 m) in height and is one of the peaks of a mountainous range. Geographically, the mountain range consists of three main hills: Ambastala Plateau of the Mango. Rajagiri, the Mountain of the King, and Aanaikuddy the Mountain of the Elephant. The word ‘Aanaikuddy’ is Tamil. Thus, this mountain range should have some connection with the Tamils, probably the Tamil Buddhist Monks.


According to Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka from India on the full moon day of the month of Poson (June) met King Devanampiyatissa and the people, and preached the doctrine. The traditional spot where this meeting took place is revered by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka. Therefore in the month of Poson, Buddhists make their pilgrimage to Anuradhapura and Mihintale.</p>
